# DimpleSF (South Facing)

The DimpleSF pcb is designed to be a drop in replacement for the stock Dimple keyboard pcb by LazyDesigners. The board features south facing hotswap support and removes the pcb standoff points to allow for more esoteric plate options and flexible assemblies. The board works however some major oversights were made during design. 

The PCB requires jumpers to MCU pins for the rows:

The PCB requires enlarging the edge cutouts for the plate mounting points as well as expanding the holes for the pcb mounts so that they fit over the PCB:

With these fixes, the pcb is compatible with the stock case and stock firmware in QMK. Obviously this board does not have RGB support.
